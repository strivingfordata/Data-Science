    "# The Best Time of the Day to Post on Hacker News\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to analyze a dataset of submissions to the popular technology site Hacker News. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_News), Hacker News is a social news website focused on computer science and entrepreneurship and it is run by Y Combinator, Paul Graham's investment fund and startup incubator.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we'll use is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts), and has almost 300,000 rows, each row representing a post. It includes the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "* title: title of the post (self explanatory)\n",
    "\n",
    "* url: the url of the item being linked to\n",
    "\n",
    "* num_points: the number of upvotes the post received\n",
    "\n",
    "* num_comments: the number of comments the post received\n",
    "\n",
    "* author: the name of the account that made the post\n",
    "\n",
    "* created_at: the date and time the post was made (the time zone is Eastern Time in the US)\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, we are particulary interested in posts whose titles begin with Ask HN and Show HN. The first one is used to aks the community a question while the second one is used to show the community something, it could be a project, a product, or just something the author finds interesting enough to share. Our goal is to determine if a post created in a particular moment of the day is more interacted with than posts cretated in other moments. In another words, we are interesd in answering the question: is there a best moment of the day to post on Hacker News?"
